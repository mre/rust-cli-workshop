# Hardly a Rust CLI workshop

Big challenges lie ahead of you.  

You'll learn some Rust by writing a commandline tool named `wc`.  
`wc` prints the number of words, lines, characters, and bytes of its input.

## Getting started

```
cd Rust
cargo new wc
```

Now Open `src/main.rs` and hack away!

Go through the tasks in the `php` folder and try to
write your version in Rust.

If you get lost, check out the code in `rust/help` to get you back on track.
